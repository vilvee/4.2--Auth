# This Docker Compose file is designed to set up a development environment with a Node.js
# service that communicates with a PostgreSQL database. The Node.js service is configured
# to connect to the database using environment variables, and the database service is initialized
# with a custom SQL script during its first run. The network mode allows seamless communication
# between the two services.

version: "3.8" # Specifies the version of the Compose file format.

services:
    # Defines the 'node' service
    node:
        image: mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/javascript-node:1-20-bullseye # Dockerfile to use for building the image.

        # 'cached' improves performance for macOS.
        volumes:
